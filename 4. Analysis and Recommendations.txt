If a company was given this data as a small company and the aim was to attract new customers, what will the strategy be? 
Given the popularity and high engagement of tweets in the Personal Growth and Finance categories, they should focus their content 
strategy around these topics. Craft tweets that offer personal development tips, motivational quotes, and financial advice. It is 
key to ensure the content being posted is valuable, actionable, and resonates with the target audience to drive engagement and 
establish the company's brand as a trusted resource. 

As California, New York, and Texas are the states with the most tweets, they should consider creating region-specific content 
that highlights local events, partnerships, or promotions. Based on the word analysis, users are responding well to positive and 
improvement-oriented language. In that way, they should incorporate phrases like "be more," "I can," and "want to" in the tweets 
to inspire and motivate the audience. It is important that the brand is associated with personal growth and financial success, 
encouraging users to achieve their goals using the company products or services.

Working with influencers can help promote the brand authentically and connect with new followers, increasing trust and credibility. 
Finally, it is important to continuously monitor the performance of the company tweets, including likes, retweets, and mentions. 
Analyzing the data to identify top-performing content and topics. Using these insights to refine the content strategy, focusing on 
what resonates most with their target audience.
